# openSAPHANA
This a demo learning project openSAP SAP HANA Development as guided by Thomas Jung / SAP Labs, LLC.
The initial project was demonstrated on HANA 2.0 SPS 03. 
However, I have completed the demo projects using HANA 2.0 SPS 04. 
In particular, I have used HANA Express Edition, installed locally on openSUSE 15.2.
